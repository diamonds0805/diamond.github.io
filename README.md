## Welcome

Thank you for looking over my coding works. Here, you will find several applications created by me using C# in Visual Studio. Coding is my ultimate passion and I truly enjoy creating new applications. I have been working in an accelerated education for the past two years and these are the projects I have worked on independently. Please enjoy this repo and look for more to come.

## Projects
Here's a list of the projects included in this repo with descriptions:

### ZooKeeper App
*	This program allows the user to select from a list of animals and interact with them
* 	The animals are categorized as trainable and nontrainable and have functions based on those traits
*  This program focuses on creating interfaces and utilizing resusable code

### Find The Errors
* 	This was an exercise where the objective was to fix all errors within the code so that there was a specified outcome
*  The errors included both syntax and logical errors

### GameConsole
* This application allows the user to select and play games listed in a menu
* The games each have their own functionality once selected by the user
* This application focuses on creating classes 

### Employee Tracker App
* This is a program that tracks employees for an employer
* Employees are categorized by rate of pay and positions held

## Conclusion
While there are many other projects that I have completed, these are the most complex and showcase my best skills. I look forward to expanding my knowledge as I grow within my career.
